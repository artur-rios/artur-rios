## Welcome to my GitHub

I'm Artur Rios, a software developer and technology enthusiast based on SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.  
Currently, I work as a Software Developer at [BTG Pactual](https://www.btgpactual.com/) bank by [BRQ Digital Solutions](https://www.brq.com/).  
Here you can find some things I work on free time. I like to code for learning new things, consolidate knowledge or test concepts and technolgies.
